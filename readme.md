# Readme

attempting to make a clean model with layers and demonstrate best practices for a basic case.. not trying to get fancy(apart from the layers?)

strategies:
- autogenerated table views should remain untouched
- layer for each view for derived (using only that view) fields or sql adjustments
- layer that applies standard non-sql adjustments.  hide keys, etc.
- each explore is expected to manage it's own explore specific/labelling adjustments (layer?)
- create table-less views for cross-view fields
- create explores for each different KPI source table
- Join the relevant entities
-

Use Cases:
1) Sales Count and Revenue
1b) Returns Count and Negative Revenue
THESE CAN BE SERVED BY AN EXPLORE WITH ORDER_ITEMS AS THE MOST GRANULAR TABLE
'What Business Entities do we want to evaluate these for?'
- Users (including demographics, geo, order history, etc)
- Products (including product hierarchy)

2) Daily Active Web Users
THESE SHOULD BE SERVED BY AN EXPLORE AT GRAIN OF DAY AND USER. WE'LL USE ORDER_ITEMS, BUT INCLUSION OF ORDER ITEM DETAILS LIKELY TO CAUSE CONFUSION
'What Business Entities do we want to evaluate these for?'
- Users (including demographics, geo, order history, etc)
- Platform (including browser, etc)

3) Web Use vs Sales
